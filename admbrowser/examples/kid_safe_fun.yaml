# This is an example of how you might use wcgbrowser on a young child's computer.
# Only the bookmarked websites are allowed, so there's no danger of the child wandering off to bad sites,
# even if the sites have ads or links to other sites.
# Popups are blocked so the child doesn't have to deal with multiple windows opening.  This can be changed, of course;
# and you can, of course, add more sites.
