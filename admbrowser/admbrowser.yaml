#########################################################
# This is the example configuration file for ADMBrowser #
#########################################################

# This file uses yaml syntax
# Just like python, indentation is critical.  Use a good text editor to hack on this.

# Start URL
# This is the "home page" for your kiosk.  It will start here, and return here if reset
# Default: about:blank

start_url: "http://www.alandmoore.com"

# Whitelist
# The "whitelist" is a list of domains or hosts which will be matched against any requested url.
# If the hostname or domain name doesn't match an item on the list, the user gets the "Cannot go there" message
# see the README file for more details on the whitelist's behavior.
# The start_url host and bookmark hosts are automatically added to the whitelist.
# To disable whitelist filtering, just comment out whitelist, leave it empty, or specify use "False" as the value.
# To just whitelist the start_url host and bookmark url host(s), just put "True".
# Otherwise, specify a list of domains or hostnames to be added to the whitelist.
# Default: empty (disabled)

#whitelist: True
#whitelist: ["alandmoore.com", "my-content-host.example.com"]

# Default User and Password
# If your browser has to navigate to a password-protected site (e.g., htaccess), you can set a default
# username and password to use.  The browser will silently send these whenever authentication is requested.

#default_user: user
#default_password: PaSsWoRd

# Proxy settings
# You can configure an HTTP proxy and port for the application to use; the format is <host>:<port>
# Alternately you can just do <host> to use the default port of 8080
# default: empty (no proxy)

#proxy_server: "192.168.1.1:3128"

# Timeout

# This is a length of time, in seconds.  If the controls are inactive for this
# length of time, the behavior defined by "timeout_mode" will be executed.
# Set to 0 to disable this feature
# Default: 0

timeout: 1800

# "timeout_mode" sets the behavior for the timeout feature
# Valid options are 'close', 'reset', or 'screensaver'
# 'close' will exit the program
# 'reset' will clear the history and go back to the start URL
# 'screensaver' will hide the navigation bar (if it exists), and take the browser
# to the screensaver_url.  Any activity will take you back to the start_url from there.
# default is 'reset'

timeout_mode: 'reset'

# Screensaver URL
# "screensaver_url" defines the URL the browser should go to in screensaver mode
# default is "about:blank"

#screensaver_url: 'http://lib.williamson-tn.org'

# Zoom Factor
# "zoom factor" determines the ratio for text/image scaling (like hitting ctrl-+ or ctrl-- on most browsers).
# 1.0 is "unzoomed", 0.5 is half-size, 2.0 is double size, etc.
# Default: 1.0

#zoom_factor: 1.5

# Allow popups
# "allow_popups" determines whether or not hyperlinks that try to open new browser windows/tabs will be honored or ignored.
# Default: False

#allow_popups: True

# Allow Plugins
# "allow_plugins" determines if plugins like flash or java will be enabled.  They must be installed seperately on the system, of course
# Default: False

#allow_plugins: True

# Force JS confirm
# "force_js_confirm" allows JavaScript are-you-sure-you-want-to-exit dialog boxes to be overriden with a default answer, "accept" or "deny". When set to "ask", the default, the user is asked each time.
# Default: "ask"

# force_js_confirm: "accept"

# Suppress alerts
# "suppress_alerts" blocks JavaScript popup alerts from appearing when True, or shows them when False.
# Default: False
# suppress_alerts: True

# SSL Mode
# "ssl_mode" decides whether problems with ssl certificates will be ignored, or if an error will be shown
# Possible values are "ignore" and "strict"
# Default: "strict"

ssl_mode: "ignore"

# Window Size
# "window_size" sets the default size of the application window.
# It can be a <width>x<height> value, like "800x600",
# the word "max", in which case the window will maximize,
# or "full", in which case the window is full-screen.
# default: 'max'

#window_size: 'full'

####################
# UI Configuration #
####################

# Navigation
# Set "navigation" to false to hide the top navigation bar.  Note that this makes bookmarks basically useless, since they won't appear.
# Default: True

#navigation: True

# "navigation_layout" is a list which sets the order and presence of buttons on the navbar from left to right.
# Valid values include "back", "forward", "refresh", "stop", "zoom_in", "zoom_out", "bookmarks", "print",  and "quit".
# "separator" will also add a separator line, and "spacer" will add an expanding spacer.
# Note that "print" will only show up if printing is enabled (allow_print), and "bookmarks" will only show up
# if bookmarks are defined.
# The default layout is ["back", "forward", "refresh", "stop", "zoom_in", "zoom_out", "separator", "bookmarks", "separator", "spacer", "quit"]
# Here's an alternative layout:

#navigation_layout: ["back", "forward", "refresh", "spacer", "bookmarks", "spacer", "quit"]

# Icon Theme
# "icon_theme" probably only works on Linux, but set it to an installed theme to set the icons for back/forward/reload/quit.
# The default is whatever your qt4 is set to use.

icon_theme:  "oxygen"

# Stylesheet
# "stylesheet" will assign a QT stylesheet to the application.  See examples for some style sheets.
# The default is empty, which will use the default system theme

#stylesheet: "examples/style.css"

# Quit Button
# "quit_button_text" changes the text on the quit/reset button at the upper right
# default is "I'm Finished"

#quit_button_text: "Quit"

# "quit_button_mode" can be either 'close' or 'reset'
# 'close' will cause the button to exit the program
# 'reset' will simply clear the browser history and return to the main page.
# default behavior is 'reset'

#quit_button_mode: 'close'

##################
# Error Messages #
##################

# Page unavailable
# "page_unavailable_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever a page cannot be accessed,
# either because it's not available, or blocked due to security rules (whitelist, e.g.).
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).
# It doesn't have to be a full page, or even HTML if you just want a simple text message.
# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#page_unavailable_html: "examples/custom404.html"

# Network Down
# "network_down_html" is the path to a *file* that contains html to be displayed whenever the start_url's host cannot be reached,
# which is very likely indicative of a network connectivity problem (rather than, say, a security restriction)
# The file should be on the local system, and only reference local resources (css, scripts, etc).
# It doesn't have to be a full page, or even HTML if you just want a simple text message.
# Leave it commented to use the default text built into the browser.
# Default: empty

#network_down_html: "examples/custom_network_down.html"

############
# Printing #
############

# Printing can be enabled by setting "allow_printing" to "True"
# When enabled, "print" will appear in the page's context menu.
# If "print" is included in the navigation layout, it will put a print button
# on the navigation bar too.
# Default: False

#allow_printing: True

# Several printing defaults can be set to allow silent printing. Please see the README.rst file for an explanation of all the options.
# Default: empty

#print_settings:
#    silent: True
#    orientation: "landscape"
#    size_unit: millimeter
#    paper_size: [500, 1000]
#    margins: [5, 5, 8, 8]
#    resolution: 300
#    mode: "screen"

# privacy_mode Configures whether or not "Private Browsing" mode is enabled on the webkit widget.
# Default: True

#privacy_mode: False

# user_agent allows the user agent string to be overriden, useful for impersonating other browsers.
# Default: WebKit default user agent

#user_agent: "ADMBrowser"

# user_css allows a custom CSS file to be applied to each page ADMBrowser visits. Accepts any URL supported by QT
# Default: none

#user_css: file://etc/admbrowser.css


#############
# Bookmarks #
#############

# Bookmarks are set in this structure.  They will appear as buttons on the top navigation bar.
# Each bookmark entry takes this form (note the indentation):
#
# key:
#   name: "&Button Label"
#   url: "http://www.example.com"
#   description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# Where "key" can be whatever you want -- most simply, a number.  The bookmarks will be sorted by key before
# being displayed, so this allows you to control the order in which they appear.
#
# There is also an older, simpler syntax that just uses the key as the name.  The downside
# is that you have no control over the order of the buttons.
#
# "&Button Label":
#    url: "http://www.example.com"
#    description: "A description of the website which will appear in the tooltip"
#
# The ampersand is optional, but if present the character following it will be the keyboard accelerator
# (e.g., in the example alt-B would activate the bookmark)
# Default: empty

bookmarks:
  1:
    name: "Alan D Moore"
    url: "http://www.alandmoore.com"
    description:  "Author's web site."

  2:
    name: "&Lykwyd Chykyn"
    url: "http://www.alandmoore.com/lc"
    description:  "The author's music."
  3:
    name: "ADM &Github"
    url:  "https://github.com/alandmoore"
    description:  "The author's github site"

# External Content

# If allow_external_content is set to True, clicking a link to an un-renderable MIME-type (PDF, for example)
# will try to open the content in a specified external application.  If it's false, it will ignore the request.
# Default: False

#allow_external_content: True

# If you're allowing external content, then you need to specify what to do with a given MIME type.
# Otherwise, the user will get an error indicating the browser doesn't know what to do with it.
# Content handlers for external files can be specified here
# The format is
# "content-type": "program to open with"
# The filename of the downloaded data will be passed as an argument

content_handlers:
  "application/pdf": "acroread"
  "application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text": "libreoffice"
